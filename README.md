### Installation Notes
Some commands will assume Blender is installed and available system-wide.

On Linux, the `node-canvas` dependency will likely need some libraries installed.

On Debian-based distributions, this command should install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install -y libpixman-1-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg8-dev libgif-dev
```
